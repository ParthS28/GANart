![GAN generated art](https://github.com/ParthS28/GANart/blob/master/generated/generated164.png)

In this repository, I have tried to explore the possibility of generating art using GANs.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Despite the low resolution, some of the artwork generated looks really cool. 

[Dataset used](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time)

The images generated are 64x64 but a few examples have been upscaled to 256x256 using [this.](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Image-Resolution-Enhancer)

I have also added the generator and discriminator model, feel free to use it and train further.
